# AI Video Generation Platform - Requirements Document

## Project Overview

An AI-powered video generation platform that automates the creation of short videos with human approval checkpoints at critical stages. The application replaces the current n8n workflow with a web-based interface that provides better control and quality assurance.

## Current Workflow Analysis

### Existing n8n Process

1. Form submission with story title/input
2. Gemini AI generates segmented response (script + video prompts)
3. For each segment:
   - Generate first frame image using Imagen4
   - Create video using PiAPI/Kling AI
   - Generate audio using Gemini TTS
   - Merge video and audio into MP4
4. Concatenate all segments into final video
