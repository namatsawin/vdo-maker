## Notes & Considerations

### Mock Data Strategy

- Use realistic sample content (scripts, images, videos)
- Store sample media files in /public/mock-assets/
- Implement different approval states to show various scenarios
- Include error states and edge cases
- Provide enough variety to demonstrate all features
- Simulate API delays and loading states for realistic UX

### Performance Considerations

- Lazy load media files and route components
- Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
- Optimize images and videos for web delivery
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Code splitting with React.lazy and Suspense
- Vite's built-in optimizations for fast development
- Manual refresh patterns instead of continuous polling

### Backend Integration Strategy

- Design components to easily accept real API data
- Use consistent data structures that match planned backend
- Implement loading states that will work with async operations
- Plan for error handling and retry mechanisms
- Abstract data fetching logic for easy API integration
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement polling intervals for status updates when backend is ready

### AI Service Integration Considerations

- Implement proper error handling for AI service failures
- Add retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Monitor API usage and costs for each service
- Implement fallback strategies for service outages
- Cache AI responses where appropriate to reduce costs
- Implement proper rate limiting to avoid service limits
- Add comprehensive logging for debugging AI integration issues
