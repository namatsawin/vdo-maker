## Next Steps (Task 2+)

The foundation is now ready for:

1. **Task 2.1**: Layout Components (Header ✅, Sidebar ✅, remaining components)
2. **Task 2.2**: Form Components (project creation, editing forms)
3. **Task 2.3**: Media Components (video player, audio player, image gallery)
4. **Task 3**: Dashboard enhancements and project management
5. **Task 4**: Workflow pages and approval system
6. **Task 5**: Enhanced mock data and state management

## How to Continue Development

1. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **View Current State**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`
   - See working dashboard with mock data
   - Test navigation between pages

3. **Add New Components**:
   - Create in appropriate `src/components/` subdirectory
   - Follow existing TypeScript patterns
   - Use Tailwind CSS for styling

4. **Extend Mock Data**:
   - Add to `src/data/mockProjects.ts`
   - Update types in `src/types/index.ts`
   - Enhance stores in `src/stores/`

## Project Status: ✅ READY FOR DEVELOPMENT

The foundation is solid and ready for building the complete AI video generation workflow interface!
